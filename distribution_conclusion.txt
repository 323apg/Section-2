Conclusion on Runtime Distributions (n=50, 100 Trials):

1. All algorithms are quite fast at n=50; most runs complete in a fraction of a millisecond.
2. Histograms show a typical right-skewed distribution, where most runs cluster at low runtime,
   but a few outliers take longer.
3. Jarvis March can exhibit a broader tail, reflecting its O(nh) complexity
   (it can approach O(n^2) when many points lie on the hull).
4. Graham Scan, Quickhull, and Monotone Chain all remain near O(n log n),
   so their runtime distributions are relatively tight.

Overall, for n=50, differences among the algorithms are modest, but Jarvis March
does show occasional slower runs compared to the others.
