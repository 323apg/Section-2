Conclusion on Convex Hull Algorithm Performance:

1. Monotone Chain (O(n log n)) remains quite efficient for all tested n.
2. Graham Scan (O(n log n)) grows similarly, though slightly higher than Monotone Chain in the data.
3. Quickhull, typically O(n log n), shows more variation but remains moderately fast for random data.
4. Jarvis March (O(nh)) can approach O(n^2) when many points lie on the hull, making it the slowest at n=1000.

Overall, the results align with theoretical complexities:
- Monotone Chain and Graham Scan scale reliably with n log n complexity.
- Jarvis March can degrade if the hull is large.
- Quickhull is usually good, but can degrade in the worst case.

All runtimes remain under 0.02 seconds at n=1000, indicating that for moderate n, any of these methods is practically feasible.
