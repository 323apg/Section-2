Conclusion on Ranges [0,1] vs. [-5,5]:

1. All four algorithms show similar growth trends in both ranges, indicating their 
   underlying time complexities (O(n log n) or O(nh)) remain the main factor.

2. Jarvis March exhibits a larger runtime difference at higher n. Since it's O(nh), 
   if the hull is bigger (which can happen more often in [-5,5]), the algorithm does more work.

3. Graham Scan, Quickhull, and Monotone Chain do not show as large a variance 
   because they are typically O(n log n) and less sensitive to hull size.

4. Overall, the difference in runtime due to range alone is modest for most algorithms, 
   but distributions that increase hull size can cause noticeable slowdowns, 
   especially for Jarvis March.

Hence, while the bounding box changes the spread of points, the biggest impact on runtime 
is still each algorithm's theoretical complexity and how many points end up on the hull.
